For financial institutions as banks to calculate the profits and taxes of their customers

Financial institutions as banks need to calculate the profits and taxes of their customers without errors. For this purpose, this program computer prototype was developed in PHP utilizing Laravel 9 framework, which has many years of developing and is very complete. 
It is a way to calculate and visualize the profits and taxes of customer investments. This prototype data come from a fixed data list, because it is an experimental program but can be adapted to utilize a DB. Therefore pagination and data edition was not possible, but an example of a complete CRUD utilizing DB  and Laravel 9 can be seen in my repository: https://github.com/aryarj/Laravel9cadcli

How the product works 
From the list are taken the inputs: initial value and invest date, and are got the outputs: investment time in months, gross and net value.
The investment will pay 0,52 % per month
The taxes are applying only to the profit and there are different taxes depend on the time:
22,5 % for less than 12 months,
18.5 % for less than 24 months and
15% for more than 24 months.
